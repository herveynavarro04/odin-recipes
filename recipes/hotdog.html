    <h3>Hotdog Final Result</h3>
    <p>A <strong>hotdog</strong> is a <i>classic comfort food</i>, consisting of a grilled or steamed sausage, usually made 
        of beef or pork, nestled in a soft, split-top bun. <strong>The sausage</strong> is often garnished with a variety 
        of condiments, including mustard, ketchup, onions, relish, and sometimes sauerkraut or pickles. 
        The combination of the savory, juicy sausage and the slightly sweet bun creates a satisfying and 
        iconic handheld treat enjoyed at picnics, barbecues, and sporting events.</p>
